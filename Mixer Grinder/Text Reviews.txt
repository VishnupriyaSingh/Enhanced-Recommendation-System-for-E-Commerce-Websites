Very compact to store. Makes chutney paste in minutes. Very handy for for grinding powder for sambar, amty.

I'm writing this review after using it for more than one year. This mixer grinder is of average quality. The jar lids are of poor quality and when closing the lids they pop out in a few seconds, have to keep holding the lids by hand to keep the jars closed during grinding. Initially I didn't hold the lids tightly by hand and whatever I was grinding flew out of the jars messed up my kitchen. I realized now looking at some of the photos posted by other buyers that the manufacturer did not provide the rubber gaskets for the lids in my box. That's why I have been struggling to use this mixer. This mixer motor needs a lot of effort for dry and wet grinding and the motor turned off in less than 2 minutes several times in the last year alone. This is a waste of money for this grinder. Also several of the reviews are fake as you will get a small card in the box that if you give positive review the manufacturer will give 6 months extended warranty, hence I maybe like others was fooled into buying this mixer looking at the reviews. So don't get fooled. Spend a little more money and buy from well known brands for peace of mind

This is a good mixer at this price point. it comes with 3 Jars. Build quality is also good.

Please use earphones while using this mixer, very high noise of this mixer

It's ok, good product

The product is making noises as if parts are loose. Not even returning the product. Please read their return policy.

The product quality is quite decent. It gets the job done superb. But donâ€™t expect very heavy duty stuff as it is not made for that. Overall very good product for the price it comes for. Satisfied.

It's been more than 4 years I am using it till now. Great deal and best product. Example of a great machine with no brand name.

Like is that product is feasible good looking good work

It's not working. Kindly replace the same. Kindly replace at the earliest.

Heating problem. To much heat...
Does not really the product. Quality is poor and it stops functioning after 10sec of use due to heating. Then have to wait for minutes so it cools off and re works.total waste of money

I order and opened the box 1 month after buying. It was strange to know that new mixer was not working and small jars cover was not fitting on it. Amazon return policy is 10 days... Sad now i cant change...Totally wasteage of money. Never buy it.

Overall it's a good quality product, cost efficient & easy to use.

It's a steal at this price. Product is good for a small family and can serve all the requirements easily. Go for it if you are not looking for heavy duty stuff.
