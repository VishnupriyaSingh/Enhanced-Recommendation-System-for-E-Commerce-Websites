"Product is very budget friendly but nothing you'll like to wear around, you might question ""Whether this smell is good?"" so won't recommend it. Suitable for those who just want a perfume and any smell will do fine"

"At first i thought it may be a fake beacuse there is tsunami of fake perfumes online and offline, but it is original so go for it,"
Check for the fogg marking on the cap and the can outlet should have a transparent plastic seal.

It's really a very good scent. Also in nice price. But the seller and company should improve their products by giving a little quality in seal packing. My product was temporarily sealed by a plastic tape which was not good to see. The company or provider and quality team should check this. All over it's good.

"I usually purchase based on riviews,"
I really wonder why so much people given 5 stars!!!!!

Just invest more and buy different product. Smells good but it doesnâ€™t last for more than 2 hours and protection also not good quantity okay .
