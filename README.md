# Hybrid Recommender System: Enhancing Recommendation Systems using Text Analytics

I have built an enhanced Recommendation system based on text analysis. In my proposed system, the new recommendation will be a combination of both start ratings and written feedbacks given by users and more accurate recommendations will be received by the users. Through this we can give a better service to the users, increase the user engagement and increase sales on e-commerce websites.
